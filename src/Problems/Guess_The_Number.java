 * The task is to write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 10. 
 * A player is then prompted to enter a guess. If the player guess wrong then the prompt 
 * appears again until the guess is correct. When the player has made a successful guess 
 * the computer will give a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
 * 
 * 
 * Extra Credit - Provide the user with a message after a guess telling them if their guess 
 * was higher than or lower than the target number.
